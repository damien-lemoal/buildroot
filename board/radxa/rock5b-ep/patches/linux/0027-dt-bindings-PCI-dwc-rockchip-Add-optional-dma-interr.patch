Subject: [PATCH 27/41] dt-bindings: PCI: dwc: rockchip: Add optional dma
 interrupts

Even though rockchip-dw-pcie.yaml inherits snps,dw-pcie.yaml
using:

allOf:
  - $ref: /schemas/pci/snps,dw-pcie.yaml#

and snps,dw-pcie.yaml does have the dma interrupts defined, in order to be
able to use these interrupts, while still making sure 'make CHECK_DTBS=y'
pass, we need to add these interrupts to rockchip-dw-pcie.yaml.

These dedicated interrupts for the eDMA are not always wired to all the
PCIe controllers on the same SoC. In other words, even for a specific
compatible, e.g. rockchip,rk3588-pcie, these dedicated eDMA interrupts
may or may not be wired.
