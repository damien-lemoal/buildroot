Subject: [PATCH 43/48] arm64: dts: rk3588: add missing PCIe eDMA interrupts

The rk3588 has 5 PCIe controllers, however, according the the rk3588 TRM
(Technical Reference Manual), only pcie3x4 has dedicated interrupts wired
to embedded DMA controller (eDMA) on the DWC PCIe controller.

The eDMA on pcie3x4 has two DMA read channels and two DMA write channels,
and according to snps,dw-pcie.yaml, the IRQs for the write channels have
to be specified before the IRQs for the read channels in "interrupts".

On the rk3588 based rock-5b board, when building with CONFIG_DW_EDMA=y:
Before this patch, only the iATUs are detected:
rockchip-dw-pcie a40000000.pcie: iATU: unroll T, 16 ob, 16 ib, align 64K, limit 8G

After this patch, both the iATUs and the eDMA channels are detected:
rockchip-dw-pcie a40000000.pcie: iATU: unroll T, 16 ob, 16 ib, align 64K, limit 8G
rockchip-dw-pcie a40000000.pcie: eDMA: unroll T, 2 wr, 2 rd
